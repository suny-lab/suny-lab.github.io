<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; color: #1B2A51">Welcome to the Sun Lab - a systems and computational neuroscience laboratory
</p>

Our research focuses on uncovering the neural circuit mechanisms underlying learning and memory. By advancing our understanding of both adaptive and maladaptive learning and memory processes, we aim to promote the translation of research findings into treatments for related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and substance-induced cognitive impairment - with the ultimate goal of enhancing human health and well-being.
